    <p><strong>1. Make the roux.</strong> in a large pot, combine flour and oil and cook, stirring constantly on medium low heat.  You have to be careful to stir it constantly, on medium low heat, so that you don’t burn it. It’s easy, but takes patience. The darker the roux, the richer the flavor!</p>
    <p><strong>2. Chop the veggies.</strong> When you're ready to make the GUmbo, start by chopping celery, onions, bell pepper, parsley, and your choice of any other vegetables you would like to add.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Brown the sausage.</strong> Add the sausage in a single layer on a hot (preferabley large) skillet and once one side is browned make sure to flip them over so they are evenly browned.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Add to a large pot.</strong> Add chicken broth, veggies, and roux to the pot and stir then stir in the cajun seasoning, to your taste.</p>
